Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

In this activtiy I created a Weather Finder. In this project I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I have used my knowledge that I have gained in my fullstack class to complete this project.  Along the way I had to look up how to do certain functions and watched alot of videos to figure out certain methods.  

This was a tough project for me but fun.  I had no previous experience with jQuery but with alot of work was able to figure things out.  

I used bootstrap for the first time as well.  I found that it was alot easier to style the page using boosttrap. I had to play with formatting alot inorder for it to work.
